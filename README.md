# y-uniffi

**This repository is WIP (Work In Progress)**

This project provides [yrs](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-crdt) bindings Swift using [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/).

`lib/` contains Rust library that wraps `yrs` crate and `udl` (UniFFI-specific interface definition file), which is required to generate Kotlin & Swift bindings.

## Decision log

We maintain a [decision log](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-uniffi/blob/main/docs/decisions.md). Please consult it in case there is some ambiguity in terms of why certain implementation details look as they are.

This project is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Thanks to

Amazing people at Mozilla for their outsanding work on [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/) and all of the supporting work they've done on using, packaging and distributing Rust code for Swift and Kotlin codebases.

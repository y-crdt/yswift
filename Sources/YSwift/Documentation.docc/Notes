### Using Snippets for code samples, when it's functional anyway

In an ideal world, the snippet code would be the definitive source here.
The snippet exists in the project as `Snippets/SyncExample.swift` to verify that it
compiles as the library advances, but the code in this article is replicated.

We're not using it directly because Swift-DocC plugin has a bug where it fails to find any
symbols for a project when it's using a local reference to a binaryTarget (as we do).
Issue reference: [https://github.com/apple/swift-docc/issues/399](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc/issues/399)

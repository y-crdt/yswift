# GitHub oriented Swift package release process

Release process:

Check out the latest code, or at the mark you want to release.
While the CI system is pretty solid, it's worthwhile to do a fresh repository clone, run a full build, and all the relevant tests before proceeding.

The process will be tagging, but not until we've made a commit that explicitly sets up the downloadable packages from GitHub release artifacts.

Steps:

- Note the version you are intending to release.
The version's tag number gets used in a number of places through this process.
This example uses the version `0.1.0`.

- Run `./scripts/build-xcframework.sh` to build the XCFramework.
Doing this regenerates the Swift wrappers from UniFFI, so the low-level wrapper swift needs to be aligned with the XCFramework that this script generates.

- Capture the build hash (sha256) of the XCFramework that the script prints out at the end of it's process.
It will look something like:

```
SHA256(yniffiFFI.xcframework.zip)= 9aa2dd069662613b66749a257d753fc7007afe4817278edfd6cc902de94b5f6c
```

The part that you need to capture and save from the above example is:

```
9aa2dd069662613b66749a257d753fc7007afe4817278edfd6cc902de94b5f6c
```

## Update Package.swift

- Switch the binary target in Package.swift for yniffiFFI to a url and checksum reference.

- Set the url to the download path for a release artifact from a GitHub release.
The version that you are releasing is embedded in this URL - `0.1.0` in this case.
The pattern is roughly:

```
https://github.com/heckj/yswift/releases/download/0.1.0/yniffiFFI.xcframework.zip
```

The end result of that section of Package.swift should look something like:

```
        .binaryTarget(
            name: "yniffiFFI",
            // Uncomment `path`, and comment out url and checksum, for local development
            // path: "./lib/yniffiFFI.xcframework"
            url: "https://github.com/y-crdt/yswift/releases/download/0.1.0/yniffiFFI.xcframework.zip",
            checksum: "9aa2dd069662613b66749a257d753fc7007afe4817278edfd6cc902de94b5f6c"
        ),
```

- Set the checksum to the one you just captured for the build of the XCFramework.
- Comment out the globalSwiftSettings that sets unsafe build flags. An external Xcode project won't allow using this package when it has "unsafe flags" defined on it.

```
var globalSwiftSettings: [PackageDescription.SwiftSetting] = []
#if swift(>=5.7)
    //globalSwiftSettings.append(.unsafeFlags(["-Xfrontend", "-strict-concurrency=complete"]))
```

(Note: at this stage, a local build will not work - as we haven't created the release yet on GitHub with its artifacts)

- Commit the changes to Package.swift.
- Tag the release after the commit, to set a point that we can build a release from.
Set the tag to a semantic version that Package.swift supports.
(Note: GitHub suggests tags like `v0.1.0`, but Swift packages have a rough time with the preceeding `v` in the semantic coding, so I recommend using a bare tag, and suffixing if `-beta` or such if you're making a beta release.)

```
git tag 0.1.0
git push origin --tags
```

- Open a browser and navigate to the URL that you can use to create a release on GitHub.
  - https://github.com/y-crdt/yswift/releases/new
  - choose the existing tag (`0.1.0` in this example)

  - Add a release title
  - Add in a description for the release
  - Drag the file `yniffiFFI.xcframework.zip` from the `lib` directory onto the github page to attach the binary.
  - Wait for the upload to complete and verify the file is listed.
  - Select the checkout for a pre-release if relevant.

(NOTE: the title and description details can be editing later without impact, but it is critically important to get the binary with the tag set as you expect - and that isn't editable if you miss it.)

- click `Publish release`

## Oops, I made a mistake - what do I do?

If something in the process goes awry, don't worry - that happens.
_Do not_ attempt to delete or move any tsgs that you've made.
Instead, just move on to the next semantic version and call it a day.
For example, when I was testing this process, I learned about the unsafe flags constraint at the last minute.
To resolve this, I repeated the process with the next tag `0.1.1` even though it didn't have any meaningful changes in the code.
